# Freqeunt Itemsets - Apriori Algorithm

This program implements the apriori algorithm to model items that are commonly purchased together and prints out these itemsets which can serve as a basis of the 'suggested item' feature that many online retailers have used to make recommendations to their customers.

The challenge in this problem is the sheer amount of data as there are over 500,000 rows of data in the retail dataset. 

The 'results.txt' file contains the generated itemsets including the support level used to prune candidate itemsets.
